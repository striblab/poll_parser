# Poll raw output translation

These scripts take a raw Stata output .txt file provided by our pollster and translate them into pandas dataframe, which is used to export a sensible Excel file, with each tab representing a question. The scripts then output HTML topline charts and HTML tables in the Star Tribune's existing style.
